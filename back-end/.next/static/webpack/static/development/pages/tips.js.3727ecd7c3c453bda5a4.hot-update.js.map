Think about the story of the flavor from the \n        beginning of that first whiff until it fades after the finish. How is the flavor \n        structured? When are different tastes introduced? Does it have a satisfying \n        conclusion? Before taking another sip, add just a few drops to a splash of water- \n        no more than 20% of the volume of your drink. Take another sip and compare. \n        How has the flavor profile changed? Keep in mind that sniffing and sipping a \n        few high ABV whiskeys can quickly numb your nose and palate. \n        Ice can suppress the flavor of the whiskey. Tasting whiskey should be a creative \n        exploration of your senses of taste and smell. Practice describing and comparing \n        flavors and as you refine your palate you will learn to appreciate them more! \n        Talk with friends to compare your flavor experiences and gain different \n        perspectives. </p>\n    </div>\n)"],"mappings":";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;AAAA;AACA;AACA;AAEA;AAAA;AACA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AACA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AACA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAEA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AALA;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;A","sourceRoot":""}
