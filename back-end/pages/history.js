        It is possible that distillation was practiced by the Babylonians in 
        Mesopotamia in the 2nd millennium BC, with perfumes and aromatics being 
        distilled, but this is subject to uncertain and disputed interpretations of 
        evidence.
        The earliest certain chemical distillations were by Greeks in Alexandria in 
        the 1st century AD, but these were not distillations of alcohol.
        The medieval Arabs adopted the distillation technique of the Alexandrian 
        Greeks, and written records in Arabic begin in the 9th century, but again 
        these were not distillations of alcohol.
        Distilling technology passed from the medieval Arabs to the medieval Latins, 
        with the earliest records in Latin in the early 12th century.
        The earliest records of the distillation of alcohol are in Italy in the 13th 
        century, where alcohol was distilled from wine. An early description of the 
        technique was given by Ramon Llull (1232 – 1315). Its use spread through 
        medieval monasteries, largely for medicinal purposes, such as the treatment of 
        colic and smallpox.
        The art of distillation spread to Ireland and Scotland no later than the 15th 
        century, as did the common European practice of distilling "aqua vitae", 
        spirit alcohol, primarily for medicinal purposes. The practice of medicinal 
        distillation eventually passed from a monastic setting to the secular via 
        professional medical practitioners of the time, The Guild of Barber Surgeons. 
        The earliest mention of whisky in Ireland comes from the seventeenth-century 
        Annals of Clonmacnoise, which attributes the death of a chieftain in 1405 to 
        "taking a surfeit of aqua vitae" at Christmas. In Scotland, the first evidence 
        of whisky production comes from an entry in the Exchequer Rolls for 1494 where 
        malt is sent "To Friar John Cor, by order of the king, to make aquavitae", 
        enough to make about 500 bottles.
        The distillation process was still in its infancy; whisky itself was not 
        allowed to age, and as a result tasted very raw and brutal compared to today's
        versions. Renaissance-era whisky was also very potent and not diluted. Over 
        time whisky evolved into a much smoother drink.
