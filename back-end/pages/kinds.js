            <h3>Malt Whisky</h3>
            <br/>
            <p>
            Malt whisky may only be made from malted barley and has to be distilled in 
            pot stills. It is distilled twice, or rarely three times, on the pot stills. 
            It is then matured in oak casks for at least three years. The longer the 
            maturation process, the more refined the flavor of the whisky. 
            </p>
            <br/>

            <h3>Grain Whisky</h3>
            <br/>
            <p>
            Grain whisky mainly comes from Scotland and Ireland and is not made from 
            malted barley but can contain any other type of grain, usually wheat. 
            Grain whisky can be distilled higher than malt whisky in column stills, 
            but contains less flavors. Grain whisky is produced primarily for the 
            blended whisky industry and is only matured for a short period of time. 
            Since 2014 more mild grain whiskies have appeared on the market, mostly as 
            single grain bottlings.

            <h3>Blended Whisky</h3>
            <br/>
            <p>
            Blended whisky can contain any mixture of malt and grain whiskies. The 
            character of a blended whisky is determined by the ratio of whiskies from 
            different distilleries. Most blends contain more grain whisky than malt 
            whisky. The more malt whisky the better the blend. Most blended whiskies 
            come from Scotland or Ireland.
            </p>

            <h3>Single Pot Still Whiskey</h3>
            <br/>
            <p>
            Single pot still whiskey is a style of Irish whiskey made from a mixed mash 
            of malted and unmalted barley and sometimes other unmalted cereals distilled 
            in a pot still. The unmalted component gives the whiskey a spicier flavor and 
            thicker texture than similar single malt whiskeys. Traditionally it is triple 
            distilled although double distillation also falls within the Irish legal 
            definition. If the whiskey is not distilled on the site of a single 
            distillery, then it may be termed pot still whiskey but not single pot 
            still whiskey. 
            </p>

            <h3>Bourbon</h3>
            <br/>
            <p>Bourbon is produced all over the United States but primarily in Kentucky; 
            named for Bourbon County in that state. Different production processes 
            define different types of bourbon. It must contain at least 51 percent 
            corn, a mixture of some barley for the fermentation process, and rye and/or 
            wheat. US law dictates that a no age statement bourbon must be aged for at 
            least 4 years in fresh, toasted casks made from American white oak. Any 
            extra maturation, similar to Scotch, is not allowed. Straight bourbon is 
            unblended.  </p>
            <br/>

            <h3>Tennessee Whiskey</h3>
            <br/>
            <p>Most Tennessee whiskeys are prepared in the same manner as bourbons, with 
            the one exception being that they are filtered through or steeped in 
            charcoal chips before going into the casks for aging, in a step known as 
            the Lincoln County Process. However US federal law does not have an 
            official legal definition for Tennessee Whiskey, it is only defined in 
            NAFTA as “a straight Bourbon Whiskey produced in the State of Tennessee.”</p>
            <br/>

            <h3>Rye Whiskey</h3>
            <br/>
            <p>Rye whiskey in the United States is made from a mash of at least 51 
            percent rye. The mash also usually includes corn and malted barley. It 
            must be matured in oak casks for two years. Canadian whisky is usually 
            referred to as “rye whisky” since historically much of the content was 
            from rye, but there is no legal requirement for Canadian whisky to include 
            rye for it to be labelled as such. Most Canadian whiskies are blends that 
            only contain a fraction of rye. </p>
            <br/>

            <h3>Corn Whiskey</h3>
            <br/>
            <p>Corn whiskey is produced in the US and must be made from a mash of at 
            least 80 percent corn and distilled to a maximum of 160 proof (80 
            percent alcohol by volume). Corn whiskey does not need wood aging at all. 
            Still some are aged in uncharred or previously used oak barrels for 6 
            months or less. A variant known as ‘straight’ corn whiskey is stored in 
            used or uncharred new oak barrels for at least two years. </p>
