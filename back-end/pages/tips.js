        <p>How to drink it:
        Check the ABV first to make sure your donâ€™t get too eager and singe your sinuses. 
        Swirl the snifter or whiskey glass by your nose to release the aromas and put the 
        glass to your face to get a good whiff, leaving your mouth open as you inhale. 
        Take a sip and chew the whisky for 3-5 seconds to let the flavor hit you, exhaling 
        through the nose as you swallow. Think about the story of the flavor from the 
        beginning of that first whiff until it fades after the finish. How is the flavor 
        structured? When are different tastes introduced? Does it have a satisfying 
        conclusion? Before taking another sip, add just a few drops to a splash of water- 
        no more than 20% of the volume of your drink. Take another sip and compare. 
        How has the flavor profile changed? Keep in mind that sniffing and sipping a 
        few high ABV whiskeys can quickly numb your nose and palate. 
        Ice can suppress the flavor of the whiskey. Tasting whiskey should be a creative 
        exploration of your senses of taste and smell. Practice describing and comparing 
        flavors and as you refine your palate you will learn to appreciate them more! 
        Talk with friends to compare your flavor experiences and gain different 
        perspectives. </p>
